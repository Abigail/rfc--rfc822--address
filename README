NAME
    RFC::RFC822::Address -- RFC 822 style address validation.

SYNOPSIS
        use RFC::RFC822::Address qw /valid/;

        print "Valid\n" if valid 'abigail@example.com';

DESCRIPTION
    This module checks strings to see whether they are have the valid
    syntax, as defined in RFC 822 [1]. One subroutine, "valid", can be
    imported, which takes a single string as argument. If the string is
    valid according to RFC 822, a true value is returned, else a false value
    is returned.

REFERENCES
    [1] David H. Crocker (revisor): "STANDARD FOR THE FORMAT OF ARPA
        INTERNET TEXT MESSAGES". RFC 822. 13 August 1982.

CAVEATS and BUGS
    This module sets the variable $Parse::RecDescent::skip. This will
    influence all other "Parse::RecDescent" parsers. And this parser will
    break if you set $Parse::RecDescent::skip to another value. It doesn't
    look that it is possible to set an alternative skip value for each
    parser, other than setting the skip value on each production.

    Example A.1.5 in RFC 822 is wrong. It should use
    *"Galloping Gourmet"@ANT.Down-Under*.

    This module should have been named "RFC::822::Address". However, perl
    5.004 doesn't like the 822 part, and at the time of this writing MacPerl
    is still at 5.004.

    This module is slow.
